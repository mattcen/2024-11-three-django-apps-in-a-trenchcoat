## Acknowledgements

Note:

I'm delivering this presentation on the unceded ancenstral lands of many Indigenous peoples.
I honour the knowledge, stewardship, and care with which they've tended this land throughout history, and recognise the deep and lasting damage that colonisation has inflicted on them.
I pledge to do my best to respect, learn from, and support these peoples. We can all do better.

# "Let's make a tech and radio outdoor wide game!"

## "It'll be fun!", he said

Note:

> wide game (n) (plural wide games):
>
>     Any of various games played by groups in a large area, such as a field or woodland.

Luke wanted to create a wide game which uses 2-way to communicate with a home base. Each radio would be at a base out in the field, and patrols of scouts would be sent to one of those bases.

Upon reaching a base, they would use the radio to contact HQ for further instructions. Each base would have a sheet of "intelligence" questions, one of which would be requested by the operator at HQ. Once the scouts answered the intelligence question, HQ would send them to another base.
