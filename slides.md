## Acknowledgements

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color: blue" -->

We're delivering this presentation on the unceded ancestral lands of many Indigenous peoples.
We honour the knowledge, stewardship, and care with which they've tended this land throughout history, and recognise the deep and lasting damage that colonisation has inflicted on them.
We pledge to do our best to respect, learn from, and support these peoples. We can all do better.

a. We don't just do fun things outdoors, but we also provide events like ScoutHack and teach Web Dev (see our lightning talk/Matt's talk).

- Sure, we do fun outdoor activities
- But also provide events like ScoutHack which teach website development
- See our Lightning Talk, or Matt's presentation for details on that; links in slide notes

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

b. We also run immersive STEM-focussed camps. We call it Star Trek: Survival.

----

<!-- .slide: data-timing="5" -->

| Rotation | Activity 1    | Activity 2    | Activity 3    |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1        | ðŸ”´ Red Team    | ðŸ’™ Blue Team   | ðŸŸ¨ Yellow Team |
| 2        | ðŸŸ¨ Yellow Team | ðŸ”´ Red Team    | ðŸ’™ Blue Team   |
| 3        | ðŸ’™ Blue Team   | ðŸŸ¨ Yellow Team | ðŸ”´ Red Team    |

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

i. Most Scouting events use a round-robin or "Track-based" program like thisâ€¦
Each team rotates through activities for a limited duration.

----

<!-- .slide: data-timing="3" -->

| Rotation | Activity 1    | Activity 2    | Activity 3    |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1        | ðŸ”´ Red Team    | ðŸ’™ Blue Team   | ðŸŸ¨ Yellow Team |
| 2        | ðŸŸ¨ Yellow Team | ðŸ”´ Red Team    | ðŸ’™ Blue Team   |
| 3        | ðŸ’™ Blue Team   | ðŸŸ¨ Yellow Team | ðŸ”´ Red Team    |

<!-- .element style="text-decoration: line-through" -->

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

- â€¦We don't do that.

Youth-Led means youth members decide how long they want to be throwing sponges at their Leaders before exploring something else.

We have made that decision capability a reality.

<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

ii. For STS, we decided to go agile and use a dispatch system to send youth members to their activities.

Shown here:
- Game board: an analogue manifestation of our software in gamified state
- In background: screen showing digital dashboard showing game state
- Around table: Youth updating team locations
- Off to side: Adult supporting

</video>

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

iii. To make an agile system work, participants gave us their top ten activity preferences, and we yeeted this into our software to make sure everyone did something they asked for to support their badge projects.

![Group of Kids on Radio](images/youth_on_radio5.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

iv. 250 Scouts were each given their own radio (a choice so poor we've done it twice now), and they received their marching orders to attend their next activity from "Starfleet Command".

----

<!-- .slide: data-timing="25" -->

![Youth at RA8 base](images/youth_on_radio3.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Check IN: Do activity

Check OUT: Request next activity

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

v. To engage in activities at this event, all the teams have to do to participate is:

- Check In to designated activity
- Do activity
- Check Out of activity
- Head to next designated activity

This methodology provided flexibility of staff, scalability of activity delivery, and most importantly, no queueing for fun!

Food and sleep also occur in designated times and areas.

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

1. An event of this style had never been achieved before.

To support such outrageously ambitious plans, ~~Luke schmoozied up to Matt~~ we very much relied on custom developed apps:

---

<!-- .slide: data-timing="15" -->

#### Django App 1
_Star Trek: Survival_ website

Explain the event and showcase the activities on offer

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

a. inform participants of the awesome activities on offer by creating a website for STS

Matt <!-- .element: style="color: blue" -->

The first Django app, a nice and simple concept.

----

<!-- .slide: data-timing="30" -->

#### Django App 2

_Brownsea_: Event Management System

Simple, secure, and speedy sign-up

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

b. register participants in a way that is fast, protects personal data, offers quality UX, and provides transparency for guardians

Matt <!-- .element: style="color:blue"-->

- Critically: Successfully implemented despite Scouts Victoria's complex hierarchical arrangement
- Designed generically, extensibly, and with modularity
- Allows us to capture key elements of event management
- Crucially, *beyond* the needs of just our event
- So others in Scouting can use this great tool too

----

<!-- .slide: data-timing="20" -->

#### Django App 3

_RadioActiv8_: the event controller

Dispatch and event operations as an activity for all youth members

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

c. gamify the distribution of participants across activity sites in a dynamic way that considered preferences for individuals and their activity team

The name RadioActiv8 is a play on the words Radio, Active, and the totes hip spelling with a number like all the cool kids do. #toTaLHacKeRbRo

<!-- .element style="justify-content: center; display: flex" -->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color:blue" -->

- To make _Star Trek: Survival_ a success:
- Packed our 3 apps into a trenchcoat
- One project to ~~rule~~ host them all:
- A single multi-app Django project
- Aimed for a 12-factor app to enable rapid redeployment
- In case everything should fall overâ€¦
- Like it did 2 hours into Day 1 of our event

FIXME: maybe show some code?

### Appropriate Info, Appropriate Access

No more, no less.

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

- We only gather data that is needed
- heath records have a dedicated confidential information system, so only catering needs are flagged to event admins.
- We use an intentionally separate health information provider, so as an event we don't need to manage that data flow here.

- conveniently, this is already built using the event models and are a breeze to customise and to enable bulk field editing.
- We see here the different activities can be switched on, off, and have content updated on the fly through this interface.

----

<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

Restricted exfiltration

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color: blue" -->

ii. Exfiltration of data was limited to Super Users for the purposes of providing catering summaries to our Kitchen staff, and our event communications teams as required. Again, less is more.

Now for some fun.

RadioActiv8 has multiple modes of play - it can be a radio wide game, and it can be used to dispatch participants to activities at an event!

The principle of RadioActiv8[^RA8Name] is quite straightforward: Bases are set out across a neighbourhood park or Scout Camp. Each base has a two-way radio, and a sign with the name of the base and an intelligence grid featuring an answer matrix.

----

<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

![RA8 Field Map](images/RA8%20Wattle%20Park%20A4.svg)
<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color:red" -->

- At the start of the game, each partcipant team is sent to a base.
- Once they arrive, they radio to HQ and identify themselves and current location.
- The HQ station responds with a question to which the team must return an answer via radio.
- On receipt of an answer, HQ provides the patrol a new destination.
- The game's end condition (and whether it is competitive) is up to the facilitator's discretion.

Easy, right? Let's record this, and then lets use this process to run an event!

----

![RadioActiv8 Mk0.1](images/ra8-0.1.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color: blue" -->

- The proof-of-concept used a sheet of paper to track the game state[^GameState] of patrols, recorded by Luke while we gave contacts the next base to attend.

- Learning: Paper does not scale.

---

![RadioActiv8 Mk0.5](images/ra8-0.5.png)
<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element style="color:blue" -->

- The Radio Conversation process is built into the form workflow
- Operators iterate the process from top of screen
- Delivered by Django Admin's "interface-for-free."

---

<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

![RA8 list of submitted events](images/ra8-0.5-event-list.png)
<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color: blue" -->

- Here we see the events - a log of each entry, tracking
  - the last known location of each team at a given time
  - the "INTEL" collected, featuring correct/incorrect flagging.
  - the next base they've been sent to.

---

<!-- .slide data-timing="1" -->

![Will](images/ra8_table_dashboards.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Note:

Luke <!-- .element style="color:red"-->

- Wide games are fun, but this process can be used to manage activites.
- Instead of bases, we use activities.
- This means HQ needs to be a little bigger than before, but Youth-Led, Adult Supported, let's make it work!

Here are our operators - an older Scout, helping a younger scout, direct OTHER scouts on where to go next!

<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color: blue" -->

i. [RA8] Use a live dashboard to show the states of change to radio operators.

# Potential questions

- Why not PHP/Laravel, or some other framework/language
- Why not Node/Javascript
  - One programming language is enough
  - Set out to do as much as we can without JS or another language
- Why Docker as opposed to "bare metal"/VM
  - Lift and shift
  - Scalability
  - Ref needing to migrate STS website at the 11th hour
