## Acknowledgements

Note:

I'm delivering this presentation on the unceded ancenstral lands of many Indigenous peoples.
I honour the knowledge, stewardship, and care with which they've tended this land throughout history, and recognise the deep and lasting damage that colonisation has inflicted on them.
I pledge to do my best to respect, learn from, and support these peoples. We can all do better.
