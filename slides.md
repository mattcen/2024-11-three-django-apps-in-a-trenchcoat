<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

- We also run immersive STEM-focussed camps. We call this one Star Trek: Survival.

| Rotation | Activity 1    | Activity 2    | Activity 3    |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1        | ðŸ”´ Red Team    | ðŸ’™ Blue Team   | ðŸŸ¨ Yellow Team |

| 3        | ðŸ’™ Blue Team   | ðŸŸ¨ Yellow Team | ðŸ”´ Red Team    |

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

- Most Scouting events use a round-robin or "Track-based" program like thisâ€¦
- Each team rotates through activities for a limited duration at a specified time.

----
<!-- .slide: data-timing="3" -->

| Rotation | Activity 1    | Activity 2    | Activity 3    |
| -------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1        | ðŸ”´ Red Team    | ðŸ’™ Blue Team   | ðŸŸ¨ Yellow Team |

<!-- .element style="text-decoration: line-through" -->

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

- â€¦ we don't do that at STS.

Youth-Led means youth members decide how long they want to be throwing sponges at their Leaders before exploring something else.

This talk demonstrates how we have made youth decision capability a reality, powered by technology.

<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

- At STS we went agile with program delivery.
- built the event around a dispatch system to send youth members to their activities via radio

Shown here:
- Game board: an analogue representation of the game-state reported by our software
- In background: screen showing digital dashboard showing game state
- Around table: Youth updating team locations
- Off to side: Adult supporting

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

[STS]

- To make an agile system work, participants gave us their top ten activity preferences
- we yeeted this into our software to make sure everyone did something they asked for to support their badge projects.
- we doubled our program from 18 activities in 2022 to 36 activities in 2024.

----
<!-- .slide: data-timing="10" -->

![Group of Kids on Radio](images/youth_on_radio5.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

- 250 Scouts, aged 5 - 26, were each given their own radio (a choice so poor we've done it twice now)
- they received their marching orders to attend their next activity from "Starfleet Command".

----
<!-- .slide: data-timing="25" -->

![Youth at RA8 base](images/youth_on_radio3.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Check IN: Do activity

Check OUT: Request next activity

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

To engage in activities at this event, all the teams have to do to participate is:

- Check In to designated activity
- Do activity
- Check Out of activity
- Head to next designated activity

This methodology provided flexibility of staff, scalability of activity delivery, and most importantly, no queueing for fun!

Food and sleep also occur in designated times and areas - these activities do not require a radio.

---
<!-- .slide: data-timing="10" -->

![STS Radios](images/sts_radio.jpeg)
<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

- An event of this style had never been achieved before.

- To support such outrageously ambitious plans, ~~Luke schmoozied up to Matt~~ we very much relied on custom developed apps:

---
<!-- .slide: data-timing="15" -->

#### Django App 1
_Star Trek: Survival_ website

Explain the event and showcase the activities on offer

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

#### Django App 1: Star Trek: Survival Website

- first Django app, a nice and simple concept
- create a website for STS to inform participants of the awesome activities on offer

----
<!-- .slide: data-timing="30" -->

#### Django App 2

_Brownsea_: Event Management System

Simple, secure, and speedy sign-up

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

#### Django App 2: Brownsea

The name Brownsea refers to Brownsea Island, the location of the first Scouting event.

- used for participant registration and team management
- implemented for speed
- security of personal data
- offers quality UX
- provides transparency for guardians


Matt <!-- .element: style="color:blue"-->

- Critically: This was successfully implemented despite Scouts Victoria's complex hierarchical arrangement
- Our apps were designed generically, extensibly, and with modularity
- This allows us to capture key elements of event management
- Crucially, it works *beyond* the needs of just our event
- So other Scouting events can use this as well

----
<!-- .slide: data-timing="20" -->

#### Django App 3

_RadioActiv8_: the event controller

Dispatch and event operations as an activity for all youth members

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

#### Django App 3: RadioActiv8

- Outsourcing the operational components of the event as an activity for youth members
- by gamifying the distribution of participants across activity sites
- maintains preference consideration for individuals and their activity teams
- The name RadioActiv8 is a play on the words Radio, Active, and the totes hip spelling of script kiddies. #toTaLHacKeRbRo

<!-- .element style="justify-content: center; display: flex" -->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color:blue" -->

- To make _Star Trek: Survival_ a success,
- We Packed our 3 apps into a trenchcoat
- We used a single, standardized environment so that we could spin it up rapidlyâ€¦
- â€¦if everything should fall overâ€¦
- â€¦
- â€¦Like it did 2 hours into Day 1 of our event

----

![Docker logo](images/docker-logo.svg)

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color: blue" -->

- Fortunately, we aimed for 12-factor apps to enable rapid redeployment
- We used OCI-compliant images helped us standardise our environment
- And chose Docker's container engine to run our containers
- To learn more about Docker, see [my Docker talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0aarx6LLzI), linked in the slide notes
- This made it easy to spin up on new infrastructure if necessary

<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

![Screenshot of login form showing 3 fields: Scout Membership number, surname, date of birth](images/brownsea-login-cropped.png)
<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color: blue" -->

[BRN]
- For our event registration system, we wanted a smooth user experience
- For a user to access our event portal, we only require:
  - Their scout membership number
  - Their surname
  - And their date of birth
- We don't store their date of birth; it's just used to authenticate against the Scouts Victoria membership API

----
<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

<video data-autoplay controls>
  <source src="images/Brownsea-rego.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <meta itemprop="description" content="Video showing 30-second registration process">
</video>

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color: blue" -->

Here's a video of the registration process:
- We confirm the user is a member of Scouts Victoria
- Offer them a list of available events
- And a list of tickets they're eligible for
- Then we pre-fill information from Scouts Victoria's membership database
- And allow them to override this if necessary
- We also request dietary information for catering
- And any other noteworthy information
- Then we present them with, and email them, an invoice, for payment

----
<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

### Appropriate Info, Appropriate Access

No more, no less.

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

[BRN]
- We only gather data that is needed
- heath records have a dedicated confidential information system, so only catering needs are flagged to event admins.
- We use an intentionally separate health information provider, so as an event we don't need to manage that data flow here.

----
<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

![Brownsea Event Supportal List](images/supportal_detail.png)
<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color: blue" -->

[BRN]
- As part of this system, legal guardians can sign in to see their children's dataâ€¦

----
<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

![Brownsea Event Supportal screenshot](images/supportal_list.png)
<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color: blue" -->

[BRN]
- â€¦ And Scout Leaders can see their Youth Members' data
- (to which they *should* already have access through member records)

----
<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

![Django Admin Page](images/django_admin.png)

Note:

Matt <!-- .element style="color: blue" -->

[BRN]
- Event administration is handled by authorised personnel using Django's Admin app, which Django offers out of the box
- This has the benefit of requiring very little setup on our part, and I think this is one Django's big strengths
- We see here the different activities can be switched on, off, and receive bulk updates

---
<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

![RA8 folder](images/ra8_folder.jpeg)
<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color:red" -->

[RA8]

Now for some fun.

RadioActiv8 has multiple modes of play - it can be a radio wide game, and it can be used to dispatch participants to activities at an event!

----
<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

![RA8 Field Map](images/RA8%20Wattle%20Park%20A4.svg)
<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Note:

Luke <!-- .element: style="color:red" -->

- At the start of the game, each partcipant team is sent to a base.
- Once they arrive, they radio to HQ and identify themselves and current location.
- The HQ station responds with a question to which the team must return an answer via radio.
- On receipt of an answer, HQ provides the team a new destination.
- The game's end condition (and whether it is competitive) is up to the facilitator's discretion.

Easy, right? Let's record this, and then lets use this process to run an event!

----
![RadioActiv8 Mk0.1](images/ra8-0.1.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color: blue" -->

- The RadioActiv8 proof-of-concept used a sheet of paper to track the game state of teams
- This state was recorded by Luke while we used the radio to tell teams which next base to attend
- Our Learning from this was: Paper does not scale

---
<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

![RA8 list of submitted events](images/ra8-0.5_2.png) <!-- .element: style="" -->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element style="color:blue" -->

- The Radio Conversation process is built into the form workflow
- Operators progress from top of screen downwards
- Again, this was initially delivered for free by Django's Admin

---
<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

![RA8 list of submitted events](images/ra8-0.5-event-list.png)<!-- .element style="width: 100%" -->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color: blue" -->

- Here we see a list of events
- a log of each entry, tracking
  - the last known **location** of each team at a given time
  - the "INTEL" collected, featuring correct/incorrect flagging.
  - the next base they've been sent to.

----
<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

![RA8 better interface](images/ra8-0.8.png)
<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color: blue" -->

- Now we create front-end styling
- and add a state-of-play dashboard to help with decision making

----
<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

![Polished RA8 frontend](images/ra8-1.0.png)
<!-- .element: class="r-stretch"-->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color: blue" -->

- â€¦ and then we match Luke's style guide. For better or worse

---

<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

![RadioActiv8 for STS](images/RadioActiv8%20-%20Play_top.png)
![RadioActiv8 for STS](images/RadioActiv8%20-%20Play_bottom.png)

<!-- .element: class="r-stretch" -->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color: blue" -->

- Then we add some buttons, specific for the event.
- some of the apps needed minor code updates to customise them for STS
- We can see the app provides feedback if entered info doesn't match its view of the world
- Here it's showing that the Team's reported location doesn't align with where they were last sent
- RadioActiv8 is smart enough to say something is wrongâ€¦
- â€¦but allows the operator to override suggestions, letting gameplay continue

---
<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

![Adult Despatchers](images/ra8-adults.jpg)<!-- .element style="width: 28%" -->
![Adult Despatchers](images/ra8-adults2.jpg)<!-- .element style="width: 50%" -->

Note:

Luke <!-- .element style="color:red"-->

- Wide games are fun, but this same process can be used to manage activities.
- Instead of intel bases, we use activities.
- This means HQ needs to be a little bigger than before, but with Youth-Led, Adult Supported, we can go from thisâ€¦

----

<!-- .slide: data-timing="1"-->

![Radio Operators](images/operators_with_youth.jpg)<!-- .element style="width: 45%" -->
![Operator Images](images/radio_user2.JPG)<!-- .element style="width: 31%" -->

Note:

- Here are our operators - an older Scout, helping a younger scout, direct OTHER scouts on where to go next!
- This is how we made outsourcing event operations possible:

----
<!-- .slide: data-timing="5"-->

Blending three apps <!--https://github.com/Scouts-Victoria-Program/sts/blob/e012c21e7c6d87e898c005fe4191f728efb0c8ba/django/myproject/settings.py#L88-L91
-->
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    â€¦
    "sts_website",
    "scoutsvic_extranet",
    "scoutsvic_ems",
    "RadioActiv8",
]
```
<!-- .element: style="width: fit-content" -->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color:blue" -->

- So back to our Trenchcoat
- we created One project to ~~rule~~ host them all:
- This was a single multi-app Django project, including our 3 apps
- App installation is as easy as:
- Adding it to the list in our Django `settings.py`
- And adding the app code to our project

----

<!-- .slide: data-timing="5"-->

Team class using registration app data

<!--https://github.com/Scouts-Victoria-Program/RadioActiv8/blob/b3b19a481be39f49c3b627bd4ef3653eeecc7c99/django/RadioActiv8/models.py#L228-L233-->
```python
class Patrol(models.Model):
    history = HistoricalRecords()
    event_patrol = models.ForeignKey(
        "scoutsvic_ems.EventPatrol",
        blank=True,
        null=True,
        on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
        )
```
<!-- .element: style="width: fit-content" -->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color: blue" -->

- Then we can connect our apps' models together
- Here we ensure that a Patrol, or team, in RadioActiv8, is related to the group of Registrants in  `scoutsvic_ems`, or Brownsea

----
<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color: blue" -->

[BRN, STS, RA8]
- Here we have an overview of the django model elements
- There's a lot here, but I'll cover some highlights:
- Team members sign in using credentials managed in the ScoutsVic_EMS (Brownsea) app
- They Register for the event via ScoutsVic_EMS (Brownsea)
- As part of Registration, they select their preferred activities
- These activities are connected to PatrolPreferences in the STS app
- When activities start and a Patrol or team, checks in with Starfleet Command
- The system consults their linked PatrolPreferences to select a candidate for their next activity

---

<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

![RA8 Mission path distance](images/ra8-mission-selection-distance.png)
<!-- .element: class="r-stretch"-->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color:blue" -->

- RadioActiv8 provides walking time estimates between bases
- Combined with a site map, operators make tactical decisions, such as:

> Do we send a team 5 year olds on a 1km journey, uphill, 20mins before lunch? No.

> Would we do this for a team of Older Scouts? Yes.

- Each base recommendation includes its estimated walking time from the team's current location
- we use GeoDjango to add geospatial integration to help with mapping data
- RadioActiv8 shows a success message at the top of the page including:
  - A timestamp
  - the Team Number
  - their Current Base
  - and their next Base, if they're in transit
- This helps keep track of what we just logged

---
<!-- .slide: data-timing="1" -->

![Base Dashboard RA8](images/ra8-base-dashboard.png)<!-- .element style="width: 28%" -->
![Patrol Dashboard RA8](images/ra8-dashboard-patrols.png)<!-- .element style="width: 70%" -->

Note:

Matt <!-- .element: style="color: blue" -->

There are two dashboards shown on the monitors.

- Each
  - uses HTMX to give up-to-date information without refreshing
  - This supports the decision making process for dispatchers without manually refreshing the page.
- the Base Dashboard on the left shows
  - Available Bases
  - Base Capacity
  - and Full bases
- the Team Dashboard on the right
 - Lists teams by number
 - And shows either:
   - their Current Location if one base is listed, or
   - their previous and next base, indicating they are in transit
 - It also displays the duration since HQ last heard from the team

- This code is all HTMX requires to auto-refresh the dashboards.
- For those who don't know H.T.M.X., it's a small JavaScript library which makes use of attributes on your HTML elements to make AJAX queries and dynamically update content, without you having to actually *write* JavaScript. You should definitely check it out!
- Single programming language for backend Dev avoiding bespoke or customized areas where, ordinarily, JS would feel like the _only_ way to solve a particular problem.

RadioActiv8 was initially developed for VicJam 2022, a state-wide Jamboree for Scouts.
The first front-end interface was written on day one of the event after months of model-testing.

- They receive summary outcomes of activity completion for each team.
- distributed via the registration system at event's end.
- ready for badge awarding the following week.

This project would not be as efficient without the contributions of many people. From development and testing to trial and error, we all did a little learning by doing.

While the code base carries a lot of the work, this would not be possible without the wonderful team at Scouts Victoria.

There is one people in particular who carried their weight and then some - please thank `@mattcen, everybody.`

Note:

Potential questions:

- Why not PHP/Laravel, or some other framework/language
- Why not Node/Javascript
  - One programming language is enough
  - Set out to do as much as we can without JS or another language
- Why Docker as opposed to "bare metal"/VM
  - Lift and shift
  - Scalability
  - Ref needing to migrate STS website at the 11th hour
